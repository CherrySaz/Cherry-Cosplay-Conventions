        <h2>About</h2>
        <p1>
            Hi! I'm Saz.
        </p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p2>
            In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, gatherings, parties and meetings of any kind came to a standstill all
            around the
            world.
        </p2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p3>
            The world had stopped.
        </p3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p4>
            After a few months, I had an idea of how wonderful it would be if we could all meet up again, if we
            could dress up at parties like we used to, if we could celebrate freedom - if we could all just enjoy
            ourselves with friends again.
        </p4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p5>
            It was time to 'Save the world'
        </p5>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p5>
            I decided to get creative. To think positively and to think how life would be again, one day. As a gamer for
            many years, I had come to play the most beloved game by the legendary, 'Epic Games'. The world famous
            'Fortnite'.
        </p5>
        <br>
        <p6>
            I was thinking of how great it would be if we could bring 'Party Royale' to life. Meeting friends, grabbing
            a pizza, a shake, doing fun activities together, just hanging out, and most of all - dancing. I
            mean, who doesn't like dancing with their friends, right?
        </p6>
        <br>
        <br>
        And so, Cherry Cosplay Coventions was born.
        <br>
        <br>
        <p6>
            With the power of Social Media, I had been able to work some magic as time went by, organising events and
            gaining interest by posting blogs and advertising meets, creating groups, and getting a community together. When
            everything started to reopen, the ball was finally rolling.
        </p6>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p7>
            To date, 'Cherry Cosplay Conventions' is the largest Fortnite conventions website in the U.K. Why not
